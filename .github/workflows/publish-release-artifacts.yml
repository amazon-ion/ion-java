# This workflow runs when a GitHub release is published.
#
# It validates that the tag correctly matches the library version, and then publishes
# artifacts for the release. Currently, this includes uploading the compiled Jar to
# the GitHub release. However, it should be extended to also include PGP signing and
# uploading to Maven Central.
#
# This workflow is almost a reusable workflow that can be used by any of our Gradle/JVM
# libraries. In order to make it reusable, we need to move it to a separate repo, update
# the workflow trigger ('on') to be 'workflow_call', and define inputs for any context
# that needs to be passed in.
#
# See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows
#
# TODO: Consider whether we should merge this with the "prepare-release" workflow rather
# than having separate workflows.
