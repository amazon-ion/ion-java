/**
 * Base type for all Ion data nodes.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> This interface should not be implemented or extended by
 * code outside of this library.
 * <p>
 * The {@code IonValue} hierarchy presents a "tree view" of Ion data;
 * every node in the tree is an instance of this class.  Since the Ion
 * type system is highly orthogonal, most operations use this
 * base type, and applications will need to examine individual instances and
 * "downcast" the value to one of the "real" types (<em>e.g.</em>,
 * {@link IonString}) in order to access the Ion content.
 * <p>
 * Besides the real types, there are other generic interfaces that can be
 * useful:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link IonText} generalizes {@link IonString} and {@link IonSymbol}
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link IonContainer} generalizes
 *     {@link IonList}, {@link IonSexp}, and {@link IonStruct}
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link IonSequence} generalizes {@link IonList} and {@link IonSexp}
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     {@link IonLob} generalizes {@link IonBlob} and {@link IonClob}
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * To determine the real type of a generic {@code IonValue}, there are three
 * main mechanisms:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     Use {@code instanceof} to look for a desired interface:
 *<pre>
 *    if (v instanceof IonString)
 *    {
 *        useString((IonString) v);
 *    }
 *    else if (v instanceof IonStruct)
 *    {
 *        useStruct((IonStruct) v);
 *    }
 *    // ...
 *</pre>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Call {@link #getType()} and then {@code switch} over the resulting
 *     {@link IonType}:
 *<pre>
 *    switch (v.getType())
 *    {
 *        case IonType.STRING: useString((IonString) v); break;
 *        case IonType.STRUCT: useStruct((IonStruct) v); break;
 *        // ...
 *    }
 *</pre>
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Implement {@link ValueVisitor} and call {@link #accept(ValueVisitor)}:
 *<pre>
 *    public class MyVisitor
 *        extends AbstractValueVisitor
 *    {
 *        public void visit(IonString value)
 *        {
 *            useString(v);
 *        }
 *        public void visit(IonStruct value)
 *        {
 *            useStruct(v);
 *        }
 *        // ...
 *     }
 *</pre>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * Use the most appropriate mechanism for your algorithm, depending upon how
 * much validation you've done on the data.
 *
 * <h2>Single-Parent Restriction</h2>
 *
 * {@code IonValue} trees are strictly hierarchical: every node has at most one
 * parent, as exposed through {@link #getContainer()} (and, implicitly,
 * {@link #getFieldName()}).  You cannot add an {@code IonValue} instance into
 * two {@link IonContainer}s; any attempt to do so will result in a
 * {@link ContainedValueException}.  You can of course add the same instance to
 * multiple "normal" {@link Collections}, since that's stepping outside of the
 * DOM.
 * <p>
 * The implication of this design is that you need to be careful when
 * performing DOM transformations.  You must remove a node from its parent
 * before adding it to another one; {@link #removeFromContainer()} is handy.
 * Alternatively you can {@link #clone()} a value, but be aware that cloning is
 * a deep-copy operation (for the very same single-parent reason).
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 *
 * <b>Mutable {@code IonValues} are not safe for use by multiple threads!</b>
 * Your application must perform its own synchronization if you need to access
 * {@code IonValues} from multiple threads. This is true even for read-only use
 * cases, since implementations may perform lazy materialization or other state
 * changes internally.
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, you can invoke {@link #makeReadOnly()} from a single thread,
 * <b>after</b> which point the value (and all recursively contained values) will
 * be immutable and hence thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that {@link #makeReadOnly()} is not guaranteed to
 * implicitly provide a synchronization point between threads.
 * This means it is the responsibility of the application to make sure
 * operations on a thread other than the one that invoked {@link #makeReadOnly()}
 * causally happen <b>after</b> that invocation observing the rules of
 * the Java Memory Model (JSR-133).
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of ensuring the correct ordering for multiple threads
 * accessing an {@link IonValue} using a {@link CountDownLatch} to explicitly
 * create a the temporal relationship:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *      // ...
 *      // Shared Between Threads
 *      // ...
 *
 *      IonValue value = ...;
 *      CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1);
 *
 *      // ...
 *      // Thread 1
 *      // ...
 *
 *      value.makeReadOnly();
 *      latch.countDown();
 *
 *      // ...
 *      // Thread 2
 *      // ...
 *
 *      // before this point operations on 'value' are not defined
 *      latch.await();
 *      // we can now operate (in a read-only way) on 'value'
 *      value.isNullValue();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In the above, two threads have a reference to <code>value</code>.
 * <code>latch</code> in this example provides a way to synchronize
 * when {@link #makeReadOnly()} happens in the first thread relative
 * to {@link #isNullValue()} being invoked on the second thread.
