/**
 * Common functionality of Ion <code>list</code> and <code>sexp</code> types.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> This interface should not be implemented or extended by
 * code outside of this library.
 * <p>
 * Ion sequences implement the standard Java {@link List} interface, behaving
 * generally as expected, with the following exceptions:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     Due to the reference-equality-based semantics of Ion sequences, methods
 *     like {@link #remove(Object)} do not use {@link Object#equals} as
 *     specified by the contract of {@link java.util.Collection}.
 *     Instead they use reference equality ({@code ==} operator) to find the
 *     given instance.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Any given {@link IonValue} instance may be a child of at most one
 *     {@link IonContainer}.  Instances may be children of any number of
 *     non-Ion {@link Collection}s.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The method {@link #subList(int, int)} is not implemented at all.
 *     We think it will be quite challenging to get correct, and decided that
 *     it was still valuable to extend {@link List} even with this contractual
 *     violation.
 *   </li>
