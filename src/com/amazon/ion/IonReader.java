/* One design goal is for the readers and writers to be independent of an
 * IonSystem or ValueFactory and thus independent of particular implementations
 * of the DOM.
 *
 * The issue is that one needs a ValueFactory in order to construct the tree.
 * So one either needs to pass a ValueFactory / IonSystem to the reader, or
 * pass the reader to the system.  I decided that the dependencies were better
 * the latter way.  So we have IonSystem.newValue(IonReader) instead of
 * IonReader.nextValue(IonSystem).
 */

/**
 * Provides stream-based access to Ion data independent of its underlying
 * representation (text, binary, or {@link IonValue} tree).
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> This interface should not be implemented or extended by
 * code outside of this library.
 * We still have some work to do before this interface is stable.
 * See <a href="https://github.com/amzn/ion-java/issues/11">issue amzn/ion-java/issues/11</a>
 * <p>
 * An {@code IonReader} has a "cursor" tracking the <em>current value</em> on
 * which the reader is positioned. Generally, newly created readers are not
 * positioned on any value. To begin traversing the Ion data, one would use
 * {@link #next()} to advance the cursor onto the first value (or learn there isn't
 * one). Once positioned, the current value's data can be accessed with the
 * {@code *Value()} methods.
 * <p>
 * When the current value is a container, calling {@link #next()} moves the
 * cursor to the <em>next sibling</em> of the container, at the same depth,
 * skipping over any children the container may have.
 * To read the children, call {@link #stepIn()},
 * then {@link #next()} to position onto the first child value (or learn there
 * isn't one).  Calling {@link #stepOut()} skips over any remaining children
 * and moves the cursor just beyond the container; call {@link #next()} to
 * move the cursor to the following value.
 * <p>
 * In general, method names are intended to parallel similar methods in the
 * {@link IonValue} hierarchy.  For example, to get the text of a symbol one
 * would use {@link #stringValue()}, mirroring {@link IonSymbol#stringValue()}.
 *
 * <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
 * {@code IonReader} is a generic interface for traversing Ion data, and it's
 * not possible to fully specify the set of exceptions that could be thrown
 * from the underlying data source.  Thus all failures are thrown as instances
 * of {@link IonException}, wrapping the original cause.  If an application
 * wants to handle (say) {@link IOException}s specially, then it needs to
 * extract that from the wrappers; the documentation of {@link IonException}
 * explains how to do that.
 *
 * <h2>Reader Facets</h2>
 * Readers are {@link Faceted} and implementations may provide additional
 * functionality accessible via the {@link #asFacet(Class)} method.
 *
 * <h3>The {@link SpanProvider} Facet</h3>
 * This facet is available on all readers that directly consume an Ion source.
 * It provides access to the "{@linkplain SpanProvider#currentSpan() current
 * span}" covering the reader's current value.
 * There is <em>not</em> a current span at the start of the source, immediately
 * after a call to {@link #stepIn()} or {@link #stepOut()}, or when the prior
 * call to {@link #next()} returned null (meaning: end of container or end of
 * stream). In such states, {@link SpanProvider#currentSpan()} will fail.
 *
 * <h3>The {@link SeekableReader} Facet</h3>
 * This facet is available on all readers <em>except</em> those created from
 * an {@link java.io.InputStream InputStream}.
 * (See <a href="https://github.com/amzn/ion-java/issues/17">issue amzn/ion-java/issues/17</a>.)
 * It allows the user to reposition the reader to a {@link Span} over the
 * same reader instance or another reader with the same source.
 *
 * <h2>Span Facets</h2>
 * Readers that support the {@link SpanProvider} facet vend {@link Span}s that
 * are also faceted.
 *
 * <h3>The {@link OffsetSpan} Facet</h3>
 * This facet is support by all readers of Ion binary and text data.
 *
 * <h3>The {@link TextSpan} Facet</h3>
 * This facet is supported by all readers of Ion text data.
