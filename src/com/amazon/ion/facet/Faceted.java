/**
 * Provides access to optional extension interfaces of a subject instance.
 * Users can request a facet of the subject by passing the desired type token
 * to {@link #asFacet(Class)}. Different implementations, or even different
 * instances, of a subject may support different facets.
 * Consult the subject's documentation to determine which facets are available
 * in each circumstance.
 *
 * <h2>Design Notes</h2>
 *
 * Given a concrete {@link Faceted} class, it may be that some instances
 * support a particular facet while others do not, depending on the state of
 * the subject or the way it was constructed. In such cases
 * {@link #asFacet(Class) asFacet} should choose whether to return the facet
 * based on the subject's state.
 * Such classes should <em>not</em> extend the facet
 * interface (directly or indirectly), since that allows clients to bypass
 * {@link #asFacet(Class) asFacet} and simply downcast the subject to the facet,
 * causing problems for instances that can't support the facet.
 *
