/**
 * A symbol table maps symbols between their textual form and an integer ID
 * used in the binary encoding.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> This interface should not be implemented or extended by
 * code outside of this library.
 * <p>
 * There are two kinds of symbol tables: <em>shared</em> and <em>local</em>.
 * With that, there are two further distinctions of shared symbol tables:
 * <em>system</em> and <em>substitute</em>.
 *
 * <h2>Notes about Substitute symbol tables</h2>
 * Substitute tables are used when the relevant catalog cannot find an exact
 * match, that is, the catalog cannot find an imported shared symtab with the
 * same name, version and max_id.
 * <p>
 * In order to ensure that we retain the correct import declarations,
 * a substitute table is created, <em>substituting</em> the originally matched
 * shared symtab from the catalog. The substitute table in turns exposes the
 * correct name, version and max_id for any callers that require it, and
 * becomes a delegate of the substituted symtab's interface.
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementations of this interface are safe for use by multiple
 * threads.</b>
