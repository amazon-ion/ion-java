/**
 * Writes Ion data to an output source.
 *
 * This interface allows the user to write Ion data without being concerned
 * about which output format is being used.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> This interface should not be implemented or extended by
 * code outside of this library.
 * We still have some work to do before this interface is stable.
 * See <a href="https://github.com/amzn/ion-java/issues/10">issue amzn/ion-java/issues/10</a>
 * <p>
 * A value is written via the set of typed {@code write*()} methods such as
 * {@link #writeBool(boolean)} and {@link #writeInt(long)}.
 * Each of these methods outputs a single Ion value, and afterwards the writer
 * is prepared to receive the data for the next sibling value.
 * <p>
 * Any type annotations must be set before the value is written.
 * Once the value has been written the "pending annotations" are erased,
 * so they are must be set again if they need to be applied to the next value.
 * <p>
 * Similarly the field name must be set before the value is
 * written (assuming the value is a field in a structure).  The field name
 * is also "erased" once used, so it must be set for each field.
 * <p>
 * To write a container, first write any annotations and/or field name
 * applicable to the container itself.
 * Then call {@link #stepIn(IonType)} with the desired container type.
 * Then write each child value in order.
 * Finally, call {@link #stepOut()} to complete the container.
 * <p>
 * Once all the top-level values have been written (and stepped-out back to
 * the starting level), the caller must {@link #close()} the writer
 * (or at least {@link #flush()} or {@link #finish()} it) before accessing
 * the data written to the underlying data sink
 * (for example, via {@link ByteArrayOutputStream#toByteArray()}).
 * The writer may have internal buffers and without closing, flushing, or
 * finishing it, it may not have written everything to the underlying data
 * sink.
 *
 * <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
 * {@code IonWriter} is a generic interface for generating Ion data, and it's
 * not possible to fully specify the set of exceptions that could be thrown
 * from the underlying data sink.  Thus all failures are thrown as instances
 * of {@link IonException}, wrapping the originating cause.  If an application
 * wants to handle (say) {@link IOException}s specially, then it needs to
 * extract that from the wrappers; the documentation of {@link IonException}
 * explains how to do that.
 *
 * @see IonStreamUtils
 * @see IonTextWriterBuilder

     * local table in order to store newly-encountered symbols.
     * <p>

     * Implementations should allow the application to continue writing further
     * top-level values following the semantics for concatenating Ion data
     * streams. If another top-level value is written, the result must behave
     * as if it were preceded by an Ion version marker, resetting the stream
     * context as if this were a new stream. (Whether or not an IVM is written

     * symbol table before writing more values. Applications that produce long

     * This is particularly useful for streams that contain an ever-growing
     * number of unique symbols to avoid unbounded growth of the symbol table,
     * which may degrade performance and bloat the encoding. Applications that
     * produce long streams with a limited number of unique symbols should
     * use {@link #flush()} instead to avoid re-declaring the local symbol
     * table unnecessarily.
