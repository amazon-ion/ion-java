/**
 * An immutable reference to a consecutive sequence of values (perhaps
 * including large hierarchies) within some base source of Ion data.
 * <p>
 * <b>WARNING:</b> This interface should not be implemented or extended by
 * code outside of this library.
 * <p>
 * A span is conceptually comprised of two abstract <em>positions</em> or
 * offsets within the base source.  The <em>start</em> position denotes the
 * leftmost edge of the span, and the <em>finish</em> position denotes the
 * rightmost edge.
 * Positions lie <em>between</em> values, and when the start and finish
 * positions are equal, the span is said to be <em>empty</em>.
 * <p>
 * A span is said to <em>cover</em> the values that lie within its edges.
 * <p>
 * A span is <em>balanced</em> if it starts and finishes within the same
 * container, otherwise it is <em>unbalanced</em>.  This library currently
 * does not support unbalanced spans.
 * <p>
 * Since different source types require different positioning techniques,
 * spans is {@link Faceted} to expose the position implementation.
 *
 * <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
 * This design and terminology is heavily based on Wilfred J. Hansen's work on
 * subsequence references.
