/**
 * Collects shared symbol tables for use by an {@link IonSystem}.
 * <p>
 * It is expected that many applications will implement this interface to
 * customize behavior beyond that provided by the default {@link SimpleCatalog}.
 * A typical implementation would retrieve symbol tables from some external
 * source.
 * <p>
 * To utilize a custom catalog, it must be given to the
 * {@link IonSystemBuilder} before a system is built, or to
 * selected methods of the {@link IonSystem} for localized use.
 *
 * <h2>Notes for Implementors</h2>
 * This interface defines two methods with subtly different semantics.
 * The first variant takes only a symbol table name, and returns the highest
 * version possible. The second takes a version number and attempts to match it
 * exactly, and if that's not possible it falls back to the the "best match"
 * possible:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If any versions <em>larger</em> than the requested version are
 *     available, select the smallest among them (still larger than requested).
 *   <li>Otherwise all available versions are <em>smaller</em> than the
 *     requested version, so return the largest of them.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Catalog implementations should <em>never</em> accept substitute symbol
 * tables and <em>never</em> return them. Substitute tables are used when the
 * catalog cannot find an exact match, that is, the catalog cannot find an
 * imported shared symtab with the same name, version and max_id. Refer to
 * {@link SymbolTable}.
 * <p>
 * This interface is the <em>only</em> abstraction point for caching shared
 * symbol tables. Within this library, there is no caching mechanism in place on
 * shared symbol tables that are loaded into the {@link IonSystem}.
 * This means that when a shared symbol table needs to be retrieved by the
 * library's code-paths, methods of this interface are invoked directly,
 * without any additional caching whatsoever.
 * As such, implementors of this interface should implement their own caching
 * mechanism if desired.
 * <p>
 * When encoding Ion binary data, its always best to use an exact match to the
 * requested version whenever possible.  Earlier versions are very likely to be
 * missing symbols that are needed by the data.  Later versions of the table
 * could have the same problem, but that's less likely under best practices.
 * <p>
 * While "get latest version" is generally okay for encoding, it's not
 * universally acceptable: one can imagine a client/server protocol where the
 * client declares what symtab/versions it can handle, and the server needs to
 * meet those requirements.
 * <p>
 * Binary <em>decoding</em> prefers an exact match, and in a couple edge cases,
 * requires it. Therefore a single "get latest version" method is insufficient.
 * See the
 * <a href="http://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/docs/symbols.html">Ion Symbols page</a>
 * for more details on this topic.
 * <p>
 * It's expected that many if not most applications will implement a dynamic
 * catalog that can fetch symtabs from some source.  In such cases the catalog
 * should make its best effort to find an exact match, and if that's not
 * possible fall back to the best match it can acquire.
