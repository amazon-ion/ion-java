/**
 * A [_Private_FastAppendable] that buffers data to blocks of memory which are managed by a [BlockAllocator]. Only when
 * [flush] is called are the blocks written to the wrapped [OutputStream].
 *
 * This is necessary for cases where an [IonManagedWriter_1_1] over Ion text needs to emit encoding directives that are
 * not known in advance. The [OutputStreamFastAppendable] class only buffers a fixed amount of data, so it is not safe
 * to use if there are system values to be written. For a sufficiently large user value, an [OutputStreamFastAppendable]
 * can end up flushing partial or whole user values flushing to the [OutputStream] before the [IonManagedWriter_1_1] can
 * write the system value that it depends on.
 *
 * Once [IonManagedWriter_1_1] supports an auto-flush feature, then this class will have very little practical
 * difference from [OutputStreamFastAppendable] for the case where no system values are needed.
 *
 * TODO:
 *   - Add proper tests
